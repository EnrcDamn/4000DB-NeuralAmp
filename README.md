# Neural Reel Saturator
-Work in progress-

Guitar plugin made with Juce, using a neural network to reproduce the pre-amp section of my old Akai 4000DB reel-to-reel tape machine.

The training was made using the [GuitarML](https://github.com/GuitarML/Automated-GuitarAmpModelling) Automated Amp Modelling submodule with a multi-parameterization model.

This is an implementation of the model from the paper: ["Real-Time Guitar Amplifier Emulation with Deep Learning"](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/3/766/htm).
